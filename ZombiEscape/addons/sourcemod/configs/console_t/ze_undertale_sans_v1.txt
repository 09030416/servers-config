    "Heya."
	{
	    "chi"    "你好呀。"
	}
	"You've been busy,huh?"
	{
	    "chi"    "你最近很忙啊，对吧？"
	}
	"So,I've got a question for ya."
	{
	    "chi"    "所以，我有一个问题要问你。"
	}
    "Do you think even the worst person can change...?"
	{
	    "chi"    "你是不是觉得即使最坏的人也能改变…？"
	}
    "That everybady can be a good person,if they just try?"
	{
	    "chi"    "觉得只要经过努力，每个人都能成为好人？"
	}
    "Heh heh heh heh..."
    {
	    "chi"    "呵呵呵呵…"
	}
	"All right."
	{
	    "chi"    "好吧。"
	}
	"Well,here's a better question."
    {
	    "chi"    "这样吧，我有一个更好的问题。"
	}
    "Do you wanna have a bad time?"
	{
	    "chi"    "你是不是想尝点苦头？"
	}
    "Cause if you take another step forward..."
	{
	    "chi"    "如果你再往前跨出一步的话…"
	}
	"You are really not going to like what happens next."
	{
	    "chi"    "接下来会发生的事你可绝对不会喜欢。"
	}
    "welp."
	{
	    "chi"    "好吧。"
	} 			
	"Sorry,old lady."
	{
	    "chi"    "抱歉了，老女士。"
	}            
	"This is why I never make promises."
	{
	    "chi"    "这就是我从不许下承诺的原因。"
	}
    "It's a beautiful day outside."
	{
	    "chi"    "今天是多美好的一天啊。"
	}
    "Birds are singing.Flowers are blooming..."
	{
	    "chi"    "小鸟在唱歌，鲜花在绽放…"
	}
    "On days like these,kids like you..."
	{
	    "chi"    "在这样的一天里，像你这样的孩子…"
	}
    "Should be burning in hell."
    {
	    "chi"    "应当在地狱里焚烧。"
	}
    "Huh."
    {
	    "chi"    "呵。"
	}
    "Always wondered why people never use their strongest attack first."
	{
	    "chi"    "我一直纳闷怎么从来没人一上来就用最强攻击呢。"
	}
    "What?You think I'm just gonna stand there and take it?"
	{
	    "chi"    "怎么着？你真以为我会站在那乖乖承受？"
	}
    "Our reports showed a massive anomaly in the timespace continuum."
	{
	    "chi"    "我们的报告显示在时空连续区中出现了大量异常。"
	}
    "Timelines jumping left and right stopping and starting..."
	{
	    "chi"    "时间线左右跳动，停止，旋即重启…"
	}
    "Until suddenly,everything ends."
    {
	    "chi"    "直至突然之间，一切戛然而止"
	}
    "Heh heh heh..."
	{
	    "chi"    "呵呵呵…"
	}
	"That's your fault,isn't it?"
	{
	     "chi"    "这些都是你造成的，不是吗？"
	}
	"You can't understand how this feels."
	{
	     "chi"    "你无法理解这种感受。"
	}
	"Knowing that one day,without any warning..."
	{
	    "chi"    "要知道总有一天，在毫无征兆下…"
	}
    "It's all going to be reset."
	{
	    "chi"    "一切事物都会归于零点。"
	}
    "Look.I gave up trying to go back a long time ago."
	{
	    "chi"    "听着，我很早之前就放弃回去了。"
	}
    "And getting to the surface doesn't really appeal anymore,either."
    {
	    "chi"    "同样的，前往地上对我来说也不再有吸引力了。"
	}
	"Cause even if we do..."
	{
	    "chi"    "因为哪怕我们真的做到了…"
	}
	"We'll just end up right back here,without any memory of it,right?"
    {
	    "chi"    "最终我们也只是回到这里，留不住任何记忆，没错吧？"
	}
    "To be blunt..."
	{
	    "chi"    "老实说…"
	}
    "It makes it kind of hard to give it my all."
	{
	    "chi"    "这让我难以全力以赴。"
	}
	"...or is that just a poor excuse for being lazy...?"
	{
	    "chi"    "…又或许这只是个为我的懒惰开脱的拙劣借口？"
	}
    "Hell if I know."
	{
	    "chi"    "鬼才清楚。"
	} 			
	"All I know is...seeing what comes next..."
	{
	    "chi"    "我所清楚的只有…一想到接下来将会发生的事…"
	}            
	"I can't afford not to care anymore."
	{
	    "chi"    "我就再也不能视而不见了。"
	}
    "Ugh...That being said..."
	{
	    "chi"    "嗯…话说回来…"
	}
    "You,uh,really like swinging that thing around,huh?"
	{
	    "chi"    "你，嗯，真的很喜欢挥舞那玩意，嗯？"
	}
    "listen."
	{
	    "chi"    "听着。"
	}
    "I konw you didn't answer me before,but..."
    {
	    "chi"    "我知道你之前都没有回应我，但是…"
	}
    "somewhere in there.I can feel it."
    {
	    "chi"    "我能感觉得到。在你心底的某处。"
	}
    "There's a glimmer of a good person inside of you."
	{
	    "chi"    "依然残留着善良的余光。"
	}
    "The memory of some one who once wanted to do the right thing."
	{
	    "chi"    "是某个曾经向往善良之人所留下的记忆。"
	}
    "Someong who,in another time,might have even been..."
	{
	    "chi"    "那个人，在另一段时空中，甚至可能是一位…"
	}
    "A friend?"
	{
	    "chi"    "朋友？"
	}
    "C'mon,buddy."
    {
	    "chi"    "行啦，伙计。"
	}
    "Do you remember me?"
	{
	    "chi"    "你还记得我吗？"
	}
	"Please,if you're listening..."
	{
	     "chi"    "拜托了，如果你听我的话…"
	}
	"Let's forget all this,ok"
	{
	    "chi"    "让我们把一切抛诸脑后，好吗？"
	}
    "Just lay down your weapon,and..."
	{
	    "chi"    "你只需要把武器放下，然后…"
	}
    "Well,my job will be a lot easier."
	{
	    "chi"    "那样的话，我的任务就会变得轻松多了。"
	}
    "Welp,it was worth a shot."
    {
	    "chi"    "得了，试一试还是值的"
	}
	"Guess you like doing things the hard way,huh?"
	{
	    "chi"    "看来你更喜欢吃点苦头，嗯？
	}
	"Sounds strange,but before all this i was secretly hoping we coule be friends."
    {
	    "chi"    "听上去很奇怪，但在这之前我还暗想着我们能成为朋友。"
	}
    "I always thought the anomaly was doing this cause they were unhappy."
	{
	    "chi"    "我一直认为那个异常者做出这种事来只是因为不幸福。"
	}
    "And when they got what they wanted,they would stop all this."
	{
	    "chi"    "而当这家伙的愿望得到满足时，就会浪子回头。"
	}
	"And maybe all they needed was...I dunno."
	{
	    "chi"    "也许他们需要的只是…我不明白。"
	}
    "Some good food,some bad laughs,some nice friends."
	{
	    "chi"    "一些美妙的食物，一些嘈杂笑声，一些有趣的朋友。"
	} 			
	"But that's ridioulous,right?Yeah,you're the type of person who won't ever be happy."
	{
	    "chi"    "但那太荒谬了，不是吗？没错，你是那种永远都不会感到幸福的人。"
	}            
	"You'll keep consuming timelines over and over,until..."
	{
	    "chi"    "你总是会不停消耗着时间线，直到…算了。"
	}
    "Well.Hey.Take it from me,kid.Some day...You gotta learn when to quit."
	{
	    "chi"    "嘿。听听我的忠告吧，小子。总有一天。你得学会知难而退。"
	}
    "And that day's today."
	{
	    "chi"    "而我说的就是今天。"
	}
    "Cause...y'see...All this fighting is really tiring me out."
	{
	    "chi"    "因为…你看…这样的战斗对我来说真的很累。！"
	}
    "And if you keep pushing me...Then I'll be forced to use my special attack."
    {
	    "chi"    "而你要是继续逼我…那我就得被迫用我的特殊攻击了。"
	}
    "So,if you don't wanna see it,now would be a good time to die."
    {
	    "chi"    "所以说，如果你不想见识，那么现在就去死吧。"
	}
    "Heh,didja really think you would be able..."
	{
	    "chi"    "呵，你还真以为就凭你也可以！"
	}
    "So..."
	{
	    "chi"    "于是…"
	}
    "Guess that's it,huh?"
	{
	    "chi"    "看来结果就是这样了，嗯？"
	}
    "Just..."
	{
	    "chi"    "总之…"
	}
    "Don't say I didn't warn you."
    {
	    "chi"    "别说我没警告过你。"
	}
    "I'm going to grillby's."
	{
	    "chi"    "我要去grillby's了。"
	}
	"Papyrus,do you want anything?"
	{
	     "chi"    "papyrus，你想来点什么吗？"
	}
	"***Hold on for 20 seconds***"
	{
	     "chi"    "***守住这里20秒***"
	}
	"***The door will close in 10 seconds***"
	{
	    "chi"    "***门还有10秒开***"
	}
    "***Human victory***"
	{
	    "chi"    "***胜利的法则已经确定！恭喜你们将本图踩在了脚下***"
	}
    "I just have one question for you,Frisk.How did you get back to the Ruins from here...?"
	{
	    "chi"    "我还有一个问题想问你，Frisk。你是怎么从这里回到Ruins的…？"
	}
    "...wait,I know.She must have taken you when she left."
    {
	    "chi"    "…等等，我知道了。她一定是在离开的时候把你也一起带走了。"
	}
	"And decided to give you a proper burial,rather than...Hanging out in the basement forever."
	{
	    "chi"    "并且打算将你妥善的安葬，而不是…把你晾在地下室里当孤魂野鬼。"
	}
	"...but,why then...?What made you wake up?Did you hear me calling you...?"
    {
	    "chi"    "…但是，为什么…？你为什么会苏醒呢？你听到我对你的呼唤了吗…？"
	}
    "It doesn't matter now.I'm so tired of this,Frisk."
	{
	    "chi"    "那无所谓了。我已经彻底厌倦了，Frisk。"
	}
    "I'm tired of all these people.I'm tired of all these places.I'm tired of being a flower."
	{
	    "chi"    "我厌倦了所有人。我厌倦了所有地方。我厌倦了当一朵花。"
	}
	"Frisk.There's just one thing left I want to do."
	{
	    "chi"    "Frisk。我只剩下最后一件事要做。去完成咱俩未竟的事业。"
	}
    "Let's finish what we started.Let's free everyone."
	{
	    "chi"    "让大家获得自由。然后…让他们看看人性究竟是什么模样！"
	} 			
	"Then...let's let them see what humanity is really like!"
	{
	    "chi"    "然后…让他们看看人性究竟是什么模样！"
	}            
	"That despite it all...This world is still kill or be killed!!"
	{
	    "chi"    "不管怎样…杀或被杀依然是这个世界的真谛！！"
	}
    "Then...?Well.I had...Been entertaining a few ways to use that power."
	{
	    "chi"    "然后…？其实，我已经…想到了不少用这个力量来作乐的法子。"
	}
    "Hee hee hee...But seeing you here changed my mind."
	{
	    "chi"    "嘻嘻嘻…但在这里遇见你，让我改变了主意"
	}
    "Frisk...I think if you're around...Just living in the surface world doedn't seem so bad."
	{
	    "chi"    "Frisk…我觉得，既然有你陪着…只是在地上普通地生活下去似乎也不那么无聊了。！"
	}
    "We don't even need to leave to get them this time.The king has six of them locked away."
    {
	    "chi"    "这次我们甚至都不必去外界搜集他们。六个灵魂正被国王锁在某处。"
	}
    "I've tried hundreds of ways to get him to show me them...But he just won't."
    {
	    "chi"    "我曾经绞尽脑汁想让他那给我看…但他就是不愿意。"
	}
    "Frisk...I know he'll do it for you."
	{
	    "chi"    "Frisk…但我知道，他肯定会让你看的。"
	}
    "Why am I telling you all of this?Frisk,I said it before."
	{
	    "chi"    "为什么要告诉你这些？Frisk，我以前告诉过你。"
	}
    "Even after all this time...You're still the only one that understands me.You won't give me any worthless pity!"
	{
	    "chi"    "就算过去了这么久…你依然是唯一理解我的人。你不会向我施舍那些毫无意义的怜悯！"
	}
    "Creatures like us...Wouldn't hesitate to kill each other if we got in each other's way."
	{
	    "chi"    "像咱俩这种人…一旦对方挡了自己的道，就一定会毫不留情地痛下杀手。"
	}
    "So that's...So...that's...Why..."
    {
	    "chi"    "所以这就是…所以…这就是…为什么……"
	}
    "...ha...ha......what's this......feeling?Why am I...Shaking?"
	{
	    "chi"    "…哈…哈……这是什么………感觉？我为什么会…发抖？"
	}
	"Hey...Frisk...No hard feelings about back then,right?"
    {
	    "chi"    "嘿…Frisk…你不会记恨我之前对你做过的事，对吧？"
	}
    "H-Hey,what are you doing!?B...back off!!"
	{
	    "chi"    "喂…喂，你要干什么！？别…别过来！！"
	}
    "I...I've changed my mind about all this.This isn't a good idea anymore."
	{
	    "chi"    "我…我彻底改变主意了。这主意看来一点都不妙。"
	}
    "Y-you should go back,Frisk.This place is fine the way it is!"
	{
	    "chi"    "你…你应该回去，Frisk。现在这样就挺好的！"
	}
    "S-s-stop making that creepy face!This isn't funny!You've got a sick sense of humor!"
	{
	    "chi"    "不…不要摆出那副凶相！这不好玩！这么做一点也不好笑！"
	}
    "***The room door will close in 10 seconds***"
    {
	    "chi"    "***房间将会在10后关闭***"
	}
    "***The stair chain has been opened.***"
	{
	    "chi"    "***楼梯锁链就要开启了。***"
	}
	"I soon realized I didn't feel Anything about Anyone."
	{
	     "chi"    "我很快发现自己对任何人都失去了感情。"
	}
	"My compassion had disappeared!"
	{
	     "chi"    "我的同情心不见了！"
	}
	"And believe me,it's not like I wasn't trying."
	{
	    "chi"    "相信我，别以为我没有尝试着去同情别人。"
	}
    "I wasted weeks with that stupid king,vainly hoping I would feel something."
	{
	    "chi"    "我在那个蠢国王身上浪费了数周时间，幻想着他能够使我动容。"
	}
    "But it became too much for me."
	{
	    "chi"    "可是久而久之，我无法忍受了。"
	}
    "I ran away from home.Eventually,I reached the Ruins.Inside I found Her,Frisk."
    {
	    "chi"    "于是我就从家里逃了出来。最后，我逃到了Ruins。在那里，我找到了她，Frisk。"
	}
	"I thought of all people,She could make me feel whole again.She failed.Ha ha..."
	{
	    "chi"    "我觉得在所有人里，只有她能让我重获情感。但她失败了。哈哈…"
	}
	"I realized those two were useless.I became despondent."
    {
	    "chi"    "我意识到他们俩都太没用了。我觉得很沮丧。"
	}
    "I just wanted to love someone.I just wanted to care about someone."
	{
	    "chi"    "我只是希望能爱上一个人。我只是希望能关心一个人。"
	}
    "Frisk,you might not believe this...But I decided...It wasn't worth living anymore."
	{
	    "chi"    "Frisk，或许你不会相信…但我觉得…这样活着已经没有意义了。"
	}
	"Not in a world without love.Not in a world without you."
	{
	    "chi"    "在一个没有爱的世界里。在一个没有你的世界里。"
	}
    "So...I decided to follow in your footsteps.I would erase myself from existence."
	{
	    "chi"    "所以…我决定随你而去。我要把自己从这世上抹除掉。"
	} 			
	"And you know what?I succeeded."
	{
	    "chi"    "然后你猜怎么样？我成功了。"
	}            
	"But as I left this mortal coil...I started to feel apprehensive."
	{
	    "chi"    "但在我将要脱离这尘世的刹那…我变得惴惴不安。"
	}
    "If you don't have a Soul,what happens when you...?Something primal started to burn inside me."
	{
	    "chi"    "如果没有灵魂，死了之后会怎么样…？有一种本能的想法开始在我脑海中燃烧。"
	}
    "No,I thought.I don't want to die!Then I woke up."
	{
	    "chi"    "不，我想到。我不想死！然后我醒了。"
	}
    "Like it was all just a bad dream.I was back at the garden.Back at my save point."
	{
	    "chi"    "就好像一切都只是一场噩梦。我回到了花园里。回到了我的保存点。"
	}
    "Interested,I decided to experiment.Again and again,I brought myself to the edge of death."
    {
	    "chi"    "有点意思，我打算做个实验。一次又一次，把自己从死亡的边缘拉了回来。"
	}
    "At any point,I could have let this world continue on without me.But as long as I was determined to live..."
    {
	    "chi"    "我随时都可以选择离开这个世界，让它继续运转。但只要我还有活下去的决心…"
	}
    "I could go back.Amazing,isn't it,Frisk?I was amazed,too."
	{
	    "chi"    "我就可以重返人世。不可思议，是吧，Frisk？我自己也很惊讶。！"
	}
    "At first,I used my powers for good.I becsme friends with everyone."
	{
	    "chi"    "起初，我用我的力量来做好事。我和每个人都成为了朋友。"
	}
    "I solved all their problems flawlessly.Their companionship was amusing..."
	{
	    "chi"    "我完美的解决了他们所有的问题。有他们做伴，我觉得很有趣…"
	}
    "For a while.As time repeated,people proved themselves predictable."
	{
	    "chi"    "好景不长。随着时间的不断重复，你会发现人是很容易被预知的。"
	}
    "What would this person say if I gave them this?What would they do if I said this to them?"
    {
	    "chi"    "如果给他这个东西，他会说什么？如果对他说这句话，他会做什么？"
	}
    "Once you konw the answer,that's it.That's all they are."
	{
	    "chi"    "一旦知道了结果，那就彻底没劲了。他们不过如此。"
	}
	"It all started because I was curious.Curious what would happen if I killed them."
	{
	     "chi"    "最先不过是为了满足我的好奇心。想知道如果我杀了他们会怎么样。"
	}
	"I don't like this,I told myself.I'm just doing this because I have to know what happens."
	{
	     "chi"    "我告诉自己，我不喜欢这样。我做这种事知识因为我非得知道答案不可。"
	}
	"Ha ha ha...What an excuse!You of all people must kniw how liberating it is to act this way."
	{
	    "chi"    "哈哈哈…多好的借口！你一定比其他人更了解这种方式是多么的令人释怀。"
	}
    "At least we're better than those sickos that stand around and watch it happen..."
	{
	    "chi"    "至少我们比那些对作恶冷眼旁观的伪君子要好…"
	}
    "Those pathetic people that want to see it,but are too weak to do it themselves."
	{
	    "chi"    "那些可怜的家伙想一睹为快，又懦弱的不敢亲自下手。"
	}
    "I bet someone like that's watching right now,aren't they...?"
    {
	    "chi"    "我打赌现在就有那种人在看着，对吧…？"
	}
	"Nowadays,even that's grown tiring.You understand,Frisk."
	{
	    "chi"    "而现在，就连作恶也开始使我厌倦了。你懂我的意思，Frisk。"
	}
	"I've done everything this world has to offer.I've read every book.I've burned every book."
    {
	    "chi"    "我已经做过了这个世界里能做的所有事。我读过了每一本书。也烧过了每一本书。"
	}
    "I've won every game.I've lost every game.I've appeased everyone.I've killed everyone."
	{
	    "chi"    "赢过每一场游戏。输过每一场游戏。让每个人心满意足。让每个人含恨而亡。"
	}
    "Set of number's...Lines of dialogue...I've seen them all."
	{
	    "chi"    "每一组数字…每一条对白…我全看过了。"
	}
	"But you...You're different.I never could predict you,Frisk."
	{
	    "chi"    "但你…你不一样。我没办法预测你的行动，Frisk。"
	}
    "When I saw you in the Ruins,I didn't recognize you.I thought I could frighten you,then steal your soul.I failed."
	{
	    "chi"    "当我第一次在Ruins见到你时，我甚至没有认出你。我以为自己能把你吓倒，然后偷走你的灵魂。但我失败了。"
	} 			
	"And when I tried to load my save file...It didn't work."
	{
